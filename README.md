# binoculars-js

This program uses Wolfram-style 1D elementary cellular automata to update a 2D cellular automata. 

This is achieved by randomly varying whether a horizontal or verticle strip of neighbors is used to compute the next state. 

For this to work, only local random updates are used (as opposed to working down the screen, computing the row below from the row above.)
